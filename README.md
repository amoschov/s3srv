# s3srv

S3-compatible server written in Java.

## What currently works:
* create, check for existence and list buckets and objects
** mostly the happy path
** without any users / keys / access restrictions (but this will come)

## TODO

A lot more ;-)

### Ideas

* different backends (memory, file, database)
